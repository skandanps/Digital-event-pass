# Digital-event-pass
UTA Digital Event Pass is an application that manages events happening in and around the campus. This application makes it simpler for our UTA STUDENT to track down events happening around them and keep them updated on their daily schedules. We have an admin who will be creating and updating the events according to specific date, time, and location. The student can log in with their UTA email ID and password and can access the application, access, and manage the events.  Using this, the users can choose to accept or decline an event invite. The users will also get notifications as pop messages about the events that they have enrolled in, and any new events created in their selected department preferences. When the user is registered to the event, they will receive a barcode for the event and the barcode will be verified by the admin before the event. We have an admin who can update, create, and delete an event respectively. UTA Digital Event Pass will provide a list of events to the users where the user can accept or decline to an event. This application will also provide notifications to the users when a new event is added. UTA Digital Event Pass also sends global notifications as well.
